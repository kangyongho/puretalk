# INDEX puretalk directory

It has two directory 'Client' and 'Server'

Client is Android that build from Android Studio.

It doesn't have Volley module. Please add on it.

Server is formed with Spring Framework.

It is used java, hibernate based on framework.

The database is MySQL.

I foucused on circumstance annotation spring IoC container and spring hibernate session factory.

You can get a hint from the source code and figure out basic component spring MVC, JSON messageconverter from spring messageconverter.

I skip the XML code and use the annotation.

I hope it helps you.
