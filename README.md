Before build this code. Please try add volley submodule.

You can get volley via git base.

"git clone https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/volley"

It's not comportable get git command.

Please try Git for windows from https://git-for-windows.github.io/ or https://desktop.github.com/

You just figure out how to use clone command.

Try just onece.

And plus it's important to try get google developer blog.

"http://developer.android.com/intl/ko/training/volley/index.html"

It's useful learn how to use Volley.
